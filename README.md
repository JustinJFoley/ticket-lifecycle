 <h3>1. Intake</h3>
The Intake stage begins when a user submits a ticket through the customer portal or via email. During this phase, the ticket is created and categorized based on predefined help topics and ticket forms. The system collects key details like the issue description, priority, and user contact information. This stage ensures the ticket is properly logged and ready for further processing.

<h3>2. Assignment and Communication</h3>
Once the ticket is created, it enters the Assignment and Communication stage. A help desk agent reviews the ticket and assigns it to the appropriate department or team based on the issue's nature. The agent communicates with the user for further clarification if needed, and sets expectations for resolution. This stage ensures the right personnel are handling the ticket and keeps the user informed throughout the process.

<h3>3. Working the Issue</h3>
During the Working the Issue stage, the assigned agent investigates and works on resolving the ticket. This can involve troubleshooting, gathering more information, or collaborating with other teams. The agent updates the ticket with their progress, notes, and any troubleshooting steps taken. It’s critical that the agent continues to communicate with the user to provide status updates or ask for additional details if necessary.

<h3>4. Resolution</h3>
In the Resolution stage, the agent successfully resolves the issue and closes the ticket. They document the final solution, ensuring the user’s problem is fully addressed. The agent may also follow up with the user to confirm satisfaction before officially closing the ticket. This stage marks the end of the ticket lifecycle, but feedback from the user can help improve future processes.
